# Introduction
## Study Background
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are particularly efficient in solving data-driven problems. They work by processing a diverse stream of data and fitting it into an optimization problem to uncover hidden patterns within the data. Recent research has shown that DNNs can be effectively used as add-on modules to enhance robot performance in trajectory tracking tasks `r Citet(bib, "zhou2020deep")`.

## Objective Of Work
The primary objective of this work is to enhance the accuracy of Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms and Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) in environments with unknown parameters and dynamic obstacles. This can be archeive by adding Deep Neural Network to improve it.
